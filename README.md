# 🧠 Brain TumAR Detection Model

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **Brain Tumor Detection Model** called **TumAAR** 🏥 using deep learning techniques. The model analyzes MRI scans to detect brain tumors with high accuracy. It leverages **YOLO for object detection** and a custom deep learning classifier for precise identification.

## 🛠 Installation
Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🎯 Features
✅ **Automated Brain Tumor Detection** from MRI scans 🏥  
✅ **YOLO-based object detection** for precise localization 🎯  
✅ **Custom-trained deep learning model** for classification 🧠  
✅ **Real-time analysis support** for medical diagnosis 📡  

## 🏃‍♂️ Usage
### 🔍 Run Detection
```bash
python detect.py --image path/to/mri_scan.jpg
```

### 📊 Train the Model
```bash
python train.py --epochs 50 --batch-size 16
```
## 📌 Sample Results
